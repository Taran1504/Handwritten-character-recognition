# Handwritten-character-recognition
Using the A-Z Handwritten Character Dataset from Kaggle and the MNIST Dataset, I developed a robust character recognition system leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Python. 
This application accurately identifies handwritten characters and digits, as demonstrated in the screenshots below. 
Key Features:
Datasets: A-Z Handwritten Character Dataset (Kaggle) & MNIST
Technology: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
