# Handwritten-character-recognition
This project implements a system to recognize handwritten characters using machine learning techniques. It combines datasets to train and evaluate a model capable of recognizing both digits and alphabetic characters.

## Features:
-Dataset Handling: Processes MNIST and "A_Z Handwritten Data" datasets.
-Data Preprocessing: Prepares data for model training.
-Model Training: Implements neural networks for character recognition.
-Evaluation: Tests the model's performance on unseen data.

## Prerequisites:
Before running the project, ensure the following libraries are installed:
-Python 3.7+
-TensorFlow
-NumPy
-Pandas
-OpenCV
-Matplotlib
-Scikit-learn

## Setup Instructions:
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-character-recognition.git
cd handwritten-character-recognition
2.Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Ensure the datasets (mnist and A_Z Handwritten Data.csv) are available in the specified directory.
4.Run the notebook using Jupyter:
jupyter notebook handwritten_character_recognition.ipynb

## Usage
-Load the datasets and preprocess them as outlined in the notebook.
-Train the model using the provided scripts.
-Evaluate the trained model on test datasets to measure accuracy.

## Dataset
-MNIST: Standard dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
-A_Z Handwritten Data: Dataset containing alphabetic characters.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfp332/a-z-handwritten-dataset-csv)
